%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
The diversity-weighetd portfolio is a functionally generated portfolio, see Example 3.4.4 of Fernholz (2002). It is generated by the diversity function (see \code{Diversity}). It can be regarded as an interpolation between the market portfolio (p = 1) and the equal-weighted portfolio (p = 0).
