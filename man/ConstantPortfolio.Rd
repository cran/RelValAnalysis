Constant-weighted Portfolio
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
The function \code{ConstantPortfolio} is creates an \code{fgp} object representing the constant-weighted portfolio with a given weight vector.
}
\usage{
ConstantPortfolio(weight)
}
\arguments{
  \item{weight}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
a numeric probability vector.
}
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
The constant-weighetd portfolio is a functionally generated portfolio generated by the geometric mean (see \code{\link{GeometricMean}}). One example is the equal-weighted portfolio. The portfolio maintains the same weight in every period.
}
\value{
An \code{fgp} object.
